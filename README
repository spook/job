Read-me file for 'job': the Linux batch job subsystem

Building
========

Unpack the source tarball or clone this repo:

    # tar -xzf job-yy.mm-nnn.tgz
            or
    # git clone https://github.com/spook/job.git

Build the components and kit

    # cd job
    # ./acbuild.sh -zcprs

Look in dist/* for your .deb or .rpm kit to install.

    # dpkg -i dist/job-*.deb
            or
    # rpm -i dist/job-*.rpm

Enjoy!
